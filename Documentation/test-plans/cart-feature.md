### Test Plan for Cart Page Feature

#### Overview
This test plan outlines the strategy for testing the cart page feature of the commerce website. The focus will be on validating functional aspects and unit testing. The testing will be conducted using Cucumber with Gherkin for BDD, Selenium for automated browser testing, and unit testing with Mockito and JUnit. A CI pipeline will be set up using GitHub Actions workflows to automate the testing process and ensure code quality.

#### Objectives
1. **Functional Testing**: Ensure that the cart page correctly handles the addition and removal of products, and displays accurate product details.
2. **Unit Testing**: Test helper methods related to cart functionality using Mockito and JUnit.
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate testing and enforce quality checks using GitHub Actions workflows.

#### Scope
- **Functional Testing**: Validating product addition, removal, and viewing in the cart, including scenarios for locked-out users and handling of an empty cart.
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual helper methods for correctness.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automating the testing process and enforcing quality controls.

#### Testing Tools
- **BDD Testing**: Cucumber with Gherkin
- **Browser Automation**: Selenium
- **Unit Testing**: Mockito and JUnit
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Removing a product from the cart and updating the cart count.
   - Viewing multiple products in the cart and verifying details like name, quantity, and price.
   - Viewing an empty cart page and ensuring the correct message is displayed.

2. **Unit Testing**
   - Verification of helper methods related to the cart page using Mockito for mocking and JUnit for assertions.

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Create and configure workflows to run unit tests on every push to the repository.
   - **Merge Conditions**: Enforce that merges to the testing branch are only allowed if all tests pass in the CI pipeline.

#### Deliverables
- **Test Scripts**: Cucumber scenarios written in Gherkin for BDD testing.
- **Automated Tests**: Selenium test scripts for functional testing.
- **Unit Test Reports**: Results from Mockito and JUnit tests for helper methods.
- **CI Pipeline Configuration**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and quality enforcement.
- **Testing Summary Report**: Comprehensive report summarizing test results and overall feature readiness.

#### Success Criteria
- Functional test cases are executed successfully and provide clear results.
- Unit tests for helper methods are executed with results indicating functionality, with any issues noted but not addressed.
- CI pipeline successfully runs all tests and enforces quality checks before allowing merges to the testing branch.
