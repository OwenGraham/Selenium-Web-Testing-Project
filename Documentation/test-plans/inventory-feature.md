### Test Plan for Inventory Page Feature

#### Overview
This test plan outlines the strategy for testing the inventory page feature of the commerce website. The focus will be on validating functional aspects, performance, and unit testing. The testing will be conducted using Cucumber with Gherkin for BDD, Selenium for automated browser testing, and JMeter for performance testing. Helper methods will be tested using Mockito and JUnit. Additionally, a CI pipeline will be set up using GitHub Actions workflows to automate the testing process and ensure code quality.

#### Objectives
1. **Functional Testing**: Ensure that the inventory page functions correctly, allowing users to view, sort, and interact with products.
2. **Performance Testing**: Assess system performance under load using JMeter.
3. **Unit Testing**: Test helper methods using Mockito and JUnit.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate testing and enforce quality checks using GitHub Actions workflows.

#### Scope
- **Functional Testing**: Validating the display and interaction of products, including sorting, adding to cart, and handling of edge cases like empty inventory and locked-out users.
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring the inventory page’s performance under varying load conditions.
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual helper methods for correctness.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automating the testing process and enforcing quality controls.

#### Testing Tools
- **BDD Testing**: Cucumber with Gherkin
- **Browser Automation**: Selenium
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter
- **Unit Testing**: Mockito and JUnit
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Viewing the inventory page with available products.
   - Sorting products by price (low to high and high to low).
   - Sorting products by name (A to Z and Z to A).
   - Adding a product to the cart.
   - Removing a product from the cart.
   - Adding multiple products to the cart.
   - Viewing product details from the inventory page.

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Inventory page performance under normal load.
   - Performance under peak load conditions using JMeter.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Verification of helper methods using Mockito for mocking and JUnit for assertions.

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Create and configure workflows to run unit tests on every push to the repository.
   - **Merge Conditions**: Enforce that merges to the testing branch are only allowed if all tests pass in the CI pipeline.

#### Deliverables
- **Test Scripts**: Cucumber scenarios written in Gherkin for BDD testing.
- **Automated Tests**: Selenium test scripts for functional testing.
- **Performance Reports**: JMeter results showing performance metrics.
- **Unit Test Reports**: Results from Mockito and JUnit tests for helper methods.
- **CI Pipeline Configuration**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and quality enforcement.
- **Testing Summary Report**: Comprehensive report summarizing test results and overall feature readiness.

#### Success Criteria
- Functional test cases, including scenarios for locked-out users, are executed successfully and provide clear results.
- Performance tests provide insights into the system’s behavior under load, with data indicating the system can handle expected usage levels.
- Unit tests for helper methods are executed with results indicating functionality, with any issues noted but not addressed.
- CI pipeline successfully runs all tests and enforces quality checks before allowing merges to the testing branch.

This test plan ensures thorough validation of the inventory page feature and leverages automated testing and CI/CD practices to maintain quality and functionality throughout the development lifecycle.
