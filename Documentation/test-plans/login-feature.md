### Test Plan for Login Feature

#### Overview
This test plan outlines the strategy for testing the login feature of the commerce website. The focus will be on validating functional aspects, performance, and unit testing. The testing will be conducted using Cucumber with Gherkin for BDD, Selenium for automated browser testing, and JMeter for performance testing. Helper methods will be tested using Mockito and JUnit. Additionally, a CI pipeline will be set up using GitHub Actions workflows to automate the testing process and ensure code quality.

#### Objectives
1. **Functional Testing**: Ensure that the login feature functions correctly.
2. **Performance Testing**: Assess system performance under load using JMeter.
3. **Unit Testing**: Test helper methods using Mockito and JUnit.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate testing and enforce quality checks using GitHub Actions workflows.

#### Scope
- **Functional Testing**: Validating the login process, including successful and failed login attempts, and handling of locked-out users.
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring login system performance under varying load conditions.
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual helper methods for correctness.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automating the testing process and enforcing quality controls.

#### Testing Tools
- **BDD Testing**: Cucumber with Gherkin
- **Browser Automation**: Selenium
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter
- **Unit Testing**: Mockito and JUnit
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Valid login with correct credentials
   - Invalid login with incorrect credentials
   - Handling of empty or missing username/password fields
   - Login attempt for a locked-out user (e.g., after multiple failed attempts)

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Login system performance under normal load
   - Performance under peak load conditions using JMeter

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Verification of helper methods using Mockito for mocking and JUnit for assertions

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Create and configure workflows to run unit tests on every push to the repository.
   - **Merge Conditions**: Enforce that merges to the testing branch are only allowed if all tests pass in the CI pipeline.

#### Deliverables
- **Test Scripts**: Cucumber scenarios written in Gherkin for BDD testing
- **Automated Tests**: Selenium test scripts for functional testing
- **Performance Reports**: JMeter results showing performance metrics
- **Unit Test Reports**: Results from Mockito and JUnit tests for helper methods
- **CI Pipeline Configuration**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and quality enforcement
- **Testing Summary Report**: Comprehensive report summarizing test results and overall feature readiness

#### Success Criteria
- Functional test cases, including scenarios for locked-out users, are executed successfully and provide clear results.
- Performance tests provide insights into the systemâ€™s behavior under load, with data indicating the system can handle expected usage levels.
- Unit tests for helper methods are executed with results indicating functionality, with any issues noted but not addressed.
- CI pipeline successfully runs all tests and enforces quality checks before allowing merges to the testing branch.

This test plan ensures thorough validation of the login feature, including scenarios for locked-out users, and leverages automated testing and CI/CD practices to maintain quality and functionality throughout the development lifecycle.
